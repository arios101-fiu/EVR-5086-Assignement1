# Polynomial Plot

Observations and the limitations of the numerical derivative. One method is an instantaneous change (associated with he tangent line. The other is an average rate of change between two points.

```{r}

# Define variables
a <- 1
n <- 1
b <- 1
p <- 2
c <- 1
q <- 3

# Create x vectors from -1 to 1
x <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, by = 0.1)

# Calculate the value of y for each value of x
y <- (a * (x^n)) + (b * (x^p)) + (c * (x^q))

# Calculate the analytical derivatives for each value of x
dy_dx <- (a * n * (x^(n - 1))) + (b * p * (x^(p - 1))) + (c * q * (x^(q-1)))

# Calculate the numerical derivatives
deltay <- diff(y)
deltax <- diff(x)
deltay_deltax <- deltay / deltax

# For plotting purposes, derive the midpoint
deltax_vec <- x[-length(x)] + deltax/2

# Build dataframe for plot

# Plot the analytically derivative as a solid line and the numerical derivative as open symbols
