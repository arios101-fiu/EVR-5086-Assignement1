# Introduction {.unnumbered}

I learned that there are various ways that I can create and execute Python chunks in R Studio [@vel√°squez2021]. Although EVR-5086 class is being taught using python, I have advanced skills in R that I hope will be complementary to the course. I am also fond of sharing science on GitHub. I have learned how GitHub pages combined with Quarto and R Studio are an extraordinary resource for developing and maintaining lab notebooks. In order to get better at using these tools and the reproducibility and accessibility of my future research, I have created a html quarto book and pdf to show my work associated with the course assignments.

# Set Up {.unnumbered}

I started by creating a GitHub account (arios101-fiu) and a GitHub repository with a gitignore and readme.md ([EVR-5086-Assignment1](https://github.com/arios101-fiu/EVR-5086-Assignement1)). I cloned the repository into R Studio, thereby creating a R project. I copied in a \_quarto.yml and index file from another project. I simplified the index file and inserted a reference to create a new reference.bib. I updated the yml, rendered, committed and pushed. Next, I turned on GitHub pages and updated the URLs in the yml and repository. On to the assignment...
