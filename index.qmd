# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Although the EVR-5086 class is being taught using Python, my prior experience is with R. I am also fond of sharing my work on GitHub.

I started by creating a GitHub account for this and potential future homework (username: arios101-fiu). Then, I created a GitHub repository with a gitignore and readme.md for this assignment ([EVR-5086-Assignment1](https://github.com/arios101-fiu/EVR-5086-Assignement1)). I cloned the repository into R Studio, thereby creating a R project. I copied in a \_quarto.yml and index.qmd files from another project. I updated the files, rendered, committed, and pushed. Next, I turned on GitHub pages and updated the URLs in the yml and repository. On to the assignment...
