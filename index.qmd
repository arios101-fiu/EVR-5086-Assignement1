## Introduction {.unnumbered}

Although the EVR-5086 class is being taught using Python, my prior experience is with R. I am also fond of sharing my work on GitHub. I have learned how GitHub pages combined with Quarto and R Studio are an extraordinary resource for developing and maintaining lab notebooks. To get better at using these tools (and the reproducibility and accessibility of my future research) I have created a html quarto book and pdf to show my work associated with the course assignments.

## Set Up {.unnumbered}

I started by creating a GitHub account (username: arios101-fiu). Then, I created a GitHub repository with a gitignore and readme.md. Initially, the repository was called EVR-5086-Assignement1, but I updated it to ([EVR-5086-Assignments](https://github.com/arios101-fiu/EVR-5086-Assignements)). I cloned the repository into R Studio, thereby creating a R project. I copied in a \_quarto.yml and index.qmd files from another project. I updated the files, rendered, committed, and pushed. Next, I turned on GitHub pages and updated the URLs in the yml and repository.
