# Plot the polynomial between x = -1 and x = 1

Observations and the limitations of the numerical derivative. One method is an instantaneous change (associated with he tangent line. The other is an average rate of change between two points.

```{r}

# Define variables
a <- 1
n <- 1
b <- 1
p <- 2
c <- 1
q <- 3

# Create vectors and data frame
x <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, by = 0.1)

# Plot the analytically derivative as a solid line and the numerical derivative as open symbols

```
