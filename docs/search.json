    "text": "Introduction\nI learned that there are various ways that I can create and execute Python chunks in R Studio (Velásquez 2021). Although EVR-5086 class is being taught using python, I have advanced skills in R that I hope will be complementary to the course. I am also fond of sharing science on GitHub. I have learned how GitHub pages combined with Quarto and R Studio are an extraordinary resource for developing and maintaining lab notebooks. In order to get better at using these tools and the reproducibility and accessibility of my future research, I have created a html quarto book and pdf to show my work associated with the course assignments.\n\n\nSet Up\nI started by creating a GitHub account (arios101-fiu) and a GitHub repository with a gitignore and readme.md (EVR-5086-Assignment1). I cloned the repository into R Studio, thereby creating a R project. I copied in a _quarto.yml and index file from another project. I simplified the index file and inserted a reference to create a new reference.bib. I updated the yml, rendered, committed and pushed. Next, I turned on GitHub pages and updated the URLs in the yml and repository. On to the assignment…\n\n\n\n\nVelásquez, Isabella. 2021. “Posit.” https://www.posit.co/.",
